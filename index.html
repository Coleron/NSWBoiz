<h3>Mesh Block</h3>

<p>Define  a  mesh  bock,  SA1.  What  years  does  the  census  take  place?
   What is  data  journalism?  Find  and  link  to  a  good  piece  of  data  journalism. <br><br>

  

Identify a possible user of the data, and a possible use. <br><br>

Identify a compelling story within your data. <br><br>  

Tell that story in words, answering the Kipling questions: who, what, how, why? <br><br>

Visualize that story on a map using colour, using legends. <br><br>

What is the latte line? How does your story relat  to the latte line? <br><br>
 
Using the height attribute, overlay complementary data that enriches the story. Explain why you chose that data. <br><br>

Arrange your maps and words in a coherent fashion. <br><br>

Think of it as a piece of data journalism that gives enough context that someone seeing the site for the first time would be able to understand everything <br><br>

<h3>Urban Data Analysis</h3>

<p> 
 
 Mesh blocks are analysed among the smallest geographical area for the Australian <br> 
 Bureau Statistics SA1 census data. The SA1 is a small Australian statistical mainframe <br> 
 which breaks up the region into smaller data collection in comparison to SA2 – SA3 etc. which holds a higher amount.<br><br>
 
 After the year 1961 the Australian Census takes place every 5 years. The latest census collected was in 2016 <br><br>

 <h2>What the Data displays</h2>
 <p>
 The Census claims that the spread of the Christian Population is around NSW, however the rate of income <br>
 is balanced by showing that the majority of earnings are moderate in the suburban areas. <br>
 For a better understanding a 3-D NSW map of the "Expanded Christian Map" is available in the tab. 
  <p>
  <br> 
 
  <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
 
 <p>Studies claim that Christianity is the largest religion in Australia being 52.1% of the whole population. <br>
 This explains why they are spread out and not concentrated in certain parts in NSW suburbs.<p>

<h1>Jeddah Economic City</h1>

 <h2>Overview</h2>
 <p>
 Jeddah Economic City or Kingdom City is a unique urban development positioned on the <br>
 north east coastline of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, led by the Jeddah Economic Company, <br>
 with an aim of promoting Jeddah as a smart city and improving community interaction. <br>
 The designated land is over five million square meters in area and is aimed to become a smartly <br>
 planned, multilayered network of business, tourism and recreational areas by 2026.
<br><br><br>
 
<p>Jeddah Tower <br><br>
Jeddah tower will become the CenterPoint of Jeddah Economic City and will erect to a record high 1000m. <br>
 This “wonder of the world” will draw tourism to the city, whilst also functioning as a <br>
 vertically integrated business area, residential area, commercial area, hotel and recreational area. <br>
 Despite Jeddah Tower’s undebatable magnificence, many local communities see this as aesthetically <br>
 unjustified as it does not visually relate and acknowledge the surrounding landscape. <br>

 <p>Transportation networks<br><br>

Jeddah economic city will be an efficient city to commute through, as both a multifaceted <br>
underground metro system and an above ground light rail system will be installed.         <br>

<br><br><br><br>
  
 <p> Vertical transportation<br><br>
  
As Jeddah Tower and many of its neighbouring skyscrapers will be excessively tall, Jeddah economic <br>
  group and its design team have developed a vast network of maglev elevators that will be efficient in <br> 
  transporting not only people but also infrastructure vertically. <br>

 <p>Integration of Urban Space<br><br>
 
Jeddah tower and the city surrounding it will plan to use its space strategically to form multipurpose <br>
  areas that promote community interaction. <br>

<br><br><br><br>
 
 <p>Interactive Information<br><br>
 
Since Jeddah economic city will serve largely as a tourist destination, installations of interactive <br> 
  information interfaces will be scattered within public areas for guidance and convenience.         <br>

 <p>Creating a CBD.<br><br>
 Jeddah currently does not have a Central Business Centre and most of its urban activity is scattered <br>
  amongst the city’s vast area. The creation of Jeddah Economic city will serve Jeddah as a new CBD, <br>
  where people collectively and commonly interact with each over within a well-planned urban environment. <br>
  To those whom will use this area as a working environment, this will be advantageous <br>
  as it provides a stable and connected business network that nurtures growth, efficiency and <br>
  integration. Opposingly, the area of the site was previously owned by local communities that will <br>
  now have to either leave and adapt to a new area or stay and adapt to a busy and populated community. <br>

 <h2>Measurement of Success</h2>
 <p> 
As one of Jeddah Economic City’s main goal is to increase tourism in the area, to prove success <br>
  tourism revenue statistics may need to be collected and analysed, to see whether the investment <br>
  was profitable. Furthermore, Jeddah Economic Company can collect transportation data to <br>
  determine the success of its newly installed transport networks and can also analyse HDI <br>
  (Human Development Index) data to prove its success in increasing quality of life. <br>
